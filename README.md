# Park Quest

Park Quest prototype web-application for the 2024 CalgaryHacks competition

## Our Project

Our project, Park Quest, is an app that encourages Calgarians to get outside and visit one of Calgary’s many parks. By using the Calgary’s parks dataset, our app provides weekly quests that encourage visiting a nearby park for at least half an hour, Calgarians can earn points that show up on a leaderboard with friends and on the Calgary-wide leaderboard.

## Why we chose Park Quest

According to CBC, “Canadians spend just over an hour in nature on weekdays, going up to two hours on weekends.” We decided that it is vital for Calgarians to get more fresh air and discover the parks in Calgary. By using a competitive leaderboard, our app lets users compete with each other to see who visits the most parks and rewards them with improved physical and mental well-being.
